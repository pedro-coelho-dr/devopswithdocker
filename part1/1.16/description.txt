I deployed this Django app to Google Cloud. 
The entire project is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/pedro-coelho-dr/libresenses.
The deployment involved modifying the settings.py file of the Django project and configuring it to run on Google Cloud using a Dockerfile.
As a few months have passed since the deployment and Google Cloud's free service period has ended, the live app is no longer accessible.
